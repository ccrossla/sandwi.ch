# CSCI3345-S19-Play-Scalajs

This is the starter project for Web Apps in Spring 2019. I'm starting you
off with a project that has both Play and Scala.js. This might seem a bit
more complex at the beginning, but it will make it easier later on because
you don't have to move things around to have both client and server projects.
